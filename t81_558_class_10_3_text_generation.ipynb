This section will demonstrate how to train an LSTM on a textual document, such as classic literature, and learn to output new text that appears to be of the same form as the training material. If you train your LSTM on [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), it will learn to crank out new prose similar to what Shakespeare had written. \n",

The LSTM is learning to construct its own words without even being shown what a word is. We will begin with character-level text generation. In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level. We will implement word-level automatic captioning in the next module.\n",
